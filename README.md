## To get started,

First, [please make sure](https://forums.expo.io/t/newly-created-app-crashes-on-ios-sim/45566) you've logged into [`expo-cli`](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/).

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

This will walk you through the creation of your Ethereum-enabled application, which works on [**Android**](https://reactnative.dev), [**iOS**](https://reactnative.dev) and the [**Web**](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).

To start the app, you can:
